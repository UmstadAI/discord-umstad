# Discord Bot has access a forum channel
# We will have already solved and archived threads, so this bot.py necessary only for recent threads

# Decide forum thread is answered or solved with tag: decide_if_solved.py
##Â We have tiny DB to store solved forum threads to prevent duplicates
## Get Active threads once a day, If active thread solved and not in the TinyDB: 
### https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
### SEND to Lambda API toProcess and Upsert it via Lambda Functions

## EXTRA: Process with gpt in other worker, and upsert into issue vector


# Gets the thread data
# Process the Data (not with gpt): Create actual processor also in lambda_functions
# Upsert it to Vector DB
